RH_gateway_visited

Use:
player.RH_gateway_visited

This tells me if you've been to my dimension the first time, for greeting messages and other funky stuff.


---
RH_left_in_room

USE:
RH_hoe.RH_left_in_room

This tells me where the hoe should be if you drop it in a room before leaving my dimension. It will be in that room upon your return.
